# Complaint Connect

Complaint Connect is a web-based platform for managing and tracking complaints. It provides different dashboards for users, workers, and administrators to handle complaints efficiently. The project aims to streamline the complaint handling process by allowing users to lodge complaints, workers to address them, and admins to manage the entire process.

## Features

- **User Dashboard**: Users can lodge complaints, track the status, and re-lodge complaints if unsatisfied.
- **Worker Dashboard**: Workers can view assigned complaints, update progress, and close complaints.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage users, workers, and complaints, assign tasks, and monitor overall performance.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload relevant documents (e.g., PDFs, images) with their complaints.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The status of complaints is updated in real-time, with notifications sent to relevant users.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for users, workers, and administrators.
- **Global Variables**: Configurations and state management for seamless interactions across different routes.
